## Overview

This repository contains an animated SVG banner designed for YouTube channels focused on data science, AI, and analytics. The banner is built to YouTube's recommended specifications (2560 × 1440 pixels) with key elements positioned within the designated safe area (1546 × 423 pixels) for optimal viewing across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: Core technology used for creating the banner
- **SVG Animation**: Implemented using native SVG `<animate>` elements
- **Vector Graphics**: All graphics are vector-based for unlimited scaling without quality loss
- **CSS Filters**: Used for creating glow effects and visual enhancements
- **XML Patterns**: Used for creating repeating elements such as binary code and neural network backgrounds

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fits all YouTube requirements for channel art
- **Animated Elements**: Subtle animations create an engaging visual experience
- **Vector-Based**: Maintains quality at any resolution or display size
- **Optimized File Size**: Despite animations, the SVG is kept efficient for web use
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify colors, text, and elements to match branding needs

## File Structure

- `banner.svg` - The main SVG file containing the complete YouTube banner
- `preview.png` - A static preview image of the banner

3. **Glow Effects**
   - Implemented using SVG `<filter>` with `<feGaussianBlur>` and composite operations
   - Different glow intensities used for visual hierarchy

4. **Text Elements**
   - Positioned strategically within the safe area
   - Font stacks include fallbacks for cross-platform compatibility
   - Text elements use filters for enhanced visibility

5. **Data Visualization Elements**
   - Chart components built with basic SVG shapes
   - Neural network visualizations with dynamic connection lines
   - Animated nodes to simulate data flow

## Usage
